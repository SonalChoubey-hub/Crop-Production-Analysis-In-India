# Crop-Production-Analysis-In-India
Author: Sonal Choubey

# 📝 Project Overview
Agriculture is the cornerstone of India’s economy, influencing both the nation's growth and rural livelihoods. This project analyzes crop production trends in India from 2000 to 2013, with a particular focus on evaluating the impact of the National Policy for Farmers (NPF-2007)—introduced to enhance agricultural productivity through better seeds, soil health awareness, and modern techniques.
The analysis includes a comparison of cultivated area and crop production before and after the 2007 policy to uncover any significant changes brought about by this initiative.

# 🎯 Objective
To perform data-driven analysis on India’s crop production data and visually assess the effects of NPF-2007. The project also features a Graphical User Interface (GUI), allowing users to interact with and visualize the data dynamically.

# 🧰 Key Features
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncover trends and patterns in crop production and cultivation.

📈 Comparative Study: Analyze agricultural metrics before and after NPF-2007.

🖼️ Dynamic GUI:

User-friendly interface for loading custom datasets

Interactive data visualization

Easy navigation for EDA tasks

📂 Flexible Input: Upload and analyze your own datasets within the GUI.

# 📅 Timeline & Policy Impact
National Policy for Farmers (NPF-2007)
Introduced to:

Ensure availability of high-quality seeds

Provide disease-free planting material

Distribute soil health cards to farmers

Support technological innovation in agriculture

This project investigates how these measures influenced agricultural productivity across various crops between 2000–2013.
The interface is intuitive, visually rich, and supports interactive exploration of datasets. Users can generate charts, trends, and insights with just a few clicks.

# 🚀 Roadmap

📌 Future Enhancements:
Integrate predictive models for crop yield forecasting
Add real-time agricultural data API integration
Deploy as a web-based tool for broader accessibility

# 🌱 Conclusion
This project provides meaningful insights into the evolution of Indian agriculture, highlighting the effects of policy changes through clear, data-driven visualization.
